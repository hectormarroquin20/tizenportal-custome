# Element Registration Abstraction - Documentation Index

> **Status:** Feasibility Study Complete - Awaiting Stakeholder Review  
> **Issue:** Further abstraction of element registration  
> **Date:** February 14, 2026

---

## 📋 Overview

This directory contains a comprehensive feasibility study for extending TizenPortal's **declarative-first architecture** to element manipulation, completing the vision of making bundles primarily declarative configuration.

**Architectural Context:** TizenPortal already has several proven declarative systems:
- ✅ Card registration (`TizenPortal.cards.register()`)
- ✅ Bundle options (manifest.json → automatic UI)
- ✅ Navigation mode configuration (manifest.json)
- ✅ Viewport locking (manifest.json)
- ✅ Feature overrides (manifest.json)

**Current State:** Despite these successes, bundles still use 85% imperative code for element manipulation (Audiobookshelf: 1,638 lines JS with ~30 `setAttribute` calls, ~15 `classList` operations).

**Proposed Enhancement:** Extend the declarative pattern to cover common element operations through a new `TizenPortal.elements.register()` API, minimizing imperative code to only bundle-specific logic.

**Expected Impact:** 40-60% reduction in bundle code complexity, faster bundle development, fewer bugs.

**Ultimate Vision:** Bundles become primarily declarative configuration with minimal imperative code reserved for highly custom, bundle-specific logic that cannot be efficiently abstracted into core.

## 🎯 Quick Reference

### Proposed API at a Glance

```javascript
// Current imperative approach (35 lines)
function setupSiderail() {
  var siderail = document.querySelector('#siderail');
  if (!siderail) return;
  siderail.setAttribute('data-tp-nav', 'vertical');
  var links = siderail.querySelectorAll('a');
  for (var i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
    links[i].setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
  }
  // ... 25+ more lines
}

// Proposed declarative approach (12 lines)
TizenPortal.elements.register({
  selector: '#siderail',
  operation: 'focusable',
  nav: 'vertical',
  classes: ['tp-spacing']
});

TizenPortal.elements.register({
  selector: '#siderail a',
  operation: 'focusable'
});
```

### Supported Operations

| Operation | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `focusable` | Make elements keyboard/remote navigable | Siderail links, buttons |
| `class` | Add/remove CSS classes | Spacing, styling classes |
| `attribute` | Set HTML attributes | ARIA labels, data attributes |
| `style` | Apply inline CSS styles | Positioning, sizing |
| `hide` / `show` | Toggle element visibility | Hide mobile hints, show desktop menus |
| `remove` | Remove elements from DOM | Ad elements (use carefully) |

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Impact | Measurement |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Code reduction** | High | 40-60% fewer lines |
| **Development speed** | High | 2-3x faster bundle creation |
| **Bug reduction** | Medium | Eliminates timing issues |
| **Maintainability** | High | Declarative = clearer intent |
| **Consistency** | High | All bundles use same patterns |

## 💡 For Bundle Authors

**If this enhancement is approved and implemented:**

1. **Existing bundles will continue working** - No breaking changes
2. **New bundles can use declarative API** - Cleaner, less code
3. **Gradual migration is supported** - Mix imperative and declarative
4. **Documentation will be comprehensive** - Examples and migration guides

**Example: Converting existing imperative code**

Before:
```javascript
var links = document.querySelectorAll('#sidebar a');
for (var i = 0; i < links.length; i++) {
  links[i].setAttribute('tabindex', '0');
}
```

After:
```javascript
TizenPortal.elements.register({
  selector: '#sidebar a',
  operation: 'focusable'
});
```

## 📖 Additional Context

### Related Systems

**Card Registration (Proven Pattern):**
- Located in `core/cards.js`
- Already uses declarative approach
- Handles focus styling, MutationObserver, tabindex
- Serves as architectural reference

**Bundle System:**
- Located in `bundles/` directory
- Currently uses lifecycle hooks (onActivate, onDeactivate)
- Would gain new declarative capabilities
- See `docs/Bundle-Authoring.md` for current approach

**Spatial Navigation:**
- Located in `navigation/` directory
- Already handles directional focus movement
- Would integrate with new `focusable` operation
- Uses `data-tp-nav` attributes for direction

### Technical Constraints

**Chrome 47 Compatibility:**
- No ES6 destructuring in source
- No async/await
- No native Promises (use callbacks)
- Babel transpiles to ES5

**Tizen TV Constraints:**
- 1920×1080 fixed resolution
- Remote input only (D-pad + color buttons)
- Manual testing required (no automated tests)
- Performance critical (low-end hardware)
