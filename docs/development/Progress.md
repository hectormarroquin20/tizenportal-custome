## Architecture

### Universal Runtime (Current)

TizenPortal uses a single unified runtime (`tizenportal.js`) on all pages:

- **Portal page:** Full runtime with grid launcher, site editor, etc.
- **Target sites:** Same runtime, detects it's not the portal and applies bundles

**Key points:**
- TizenBrew injects `dist/tizenportal.js` into all pages
- No separate "userScript" or dual builds
- Bundles are compiled into the runtime
- Payload passed via URL hash for bundle selection

---
